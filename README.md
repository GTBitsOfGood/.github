Hey! We are Bits of Good, a nonprofit focused on <strong>Changing lives <em>one bit at a time.</em></strong> Based in Georgia Tech, the GT Bits of Good team connects our students with local nonprofits by building powerful web apps.
Our nonprofit started when a young Rhea Chatterjee revived the dying Humanitech initiative, striving to connect students with ATL nonprofits. Helped by the talented Andre Hijaouy and Anna Herrera, a robust, rebranded organization was born: Bits of Good.
From then on, our organization has expanded to partner with Hack4Impact to take on nonprofit projects, and also has introduced bootcamps for thousands of students learning to make an impact. 

<h3>Connecting with Atlanta 🏙️</h3>
By building relationships with local nonprofits, we are redefining social good for students who want to make a meaningful impact with their technical background.

<h3>Building Powerful Web Apps 🧑‍💻</h3>
Our organization develops real-world applications and promotes learning and mentorship at all levels, both from team members of diverse skill sets and from the close-knit, passionate club community.
